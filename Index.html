        <h2>What is CKD? </h2>
        <p> it is a long-term condition in which the kidneys do not function properly, leading
            to impaired functionality. Various conditions can cause CKD. Most of the time, CKD does not produce
            symptoms and may remain undetectable until it has reached an advanced stage. Additionally, CKD may not
            necessarily progress to kidney failure. However, patients at any stage of CKD face an increased risk of
            developing bloolcardiovascular diseases, such as heart disease or stroke.</p>
